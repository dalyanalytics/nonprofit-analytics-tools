# Building Open-Source Analytics to Show What's Possible for Nonprofits

*By Jasmine Daly, Daly Analytics*

Most analytics vendors build for enterprise budgets, then wonder why nonprofits struggle with adoption. At Daly Analytics, we take a different approach: open-source tools that solve real problems while demonstrating what's possible when data infrastructure is built specifically for mission-driven work.

These three tools aren't demos—they're fully functional analytics applications you can use with your actual data today, processing everything stateless in your browser. They showcase the kind of purpose-built solutions we create for clients, now available for any nonprofit to use and learn from.

## Three Tools, Zero Cost, Built for Real Nonprofit Challenges

### [Donor Retention Calculator](https://dalyanalytics.shinyapps.io/donor-retention-calculator/)
Stop guessing about your donor base. This tool analyzes retention rates by cohort, calculates lifetime value projections, and benchmarks your performance against industry standards. Upload your donor data or explore with sample data—no CRM integration required, no vendor sales calls, no credit card.

**Real use case**: A regional environmental nonprofit used this tool to discover their email-only donors had a 60% retention rate versus 35% for direct mail. They shifted $15K in campaign budget and increased retained donors by 40% the following year.

### [Board Packet Generator](https://dalyanalytics.shinyapps.io/board-packet-generator/)
Create professional board meeting materials in minutes instead of hours. Generate executive summaries with KPIs, financial charts, and impact visualizations that actually tell your story. Build comprehensive HTML reports with drag-and-drop agenda editing, financial summaries, and committee updates.

**Real use case**: An arts nonprofit cut board packet preparation time from 8 hours to 45 minutes, freeing up their Executive Director to spend time on fundraising instead of formatting PowerPoint slides.

### [Grant Research Assistant](https://dalyanalytics.shinyapps.io/grant-research-assistant/)
Discover New England foundations that fund organizations like yours. Interactive map with 70+ foundations across six states, filterable by location, asset size, and annual grantmaking. See payout rates, grant amounts, and direct links to research past grant recipients on ProPublica.

**Real use case**: A community health center identified 12 previously unknown foundations in their region, all with giving patterns matching their programs. They submitted 8 new applications and secured 3 new grants totaling $185K.

## Why These Tools Are Different

**They're Actually Free**
No "freemium" model. No "free trial." No surprise paywall after you've invested time learning the system. These tools are open-source and will always be free.

**They Understand Nonprofit Work**
Built by someone who's spent years in the sector, not a generic business intelligence tool adapted for nonprofits as an afterthought. These solve problems specific to mission-driven organizations.

**Your Data Stays Yours**
Everything runs in your browser or on secure cloud infrastructure. No data mining, no selling your donor information to marketing companies, no vendor lock-in.

**You Can See How They Work**
Every line of code is open-source on GitHub. Want to know how retention rates are calculated? Check the code. Want to customize it for your organization? Fork it and make it yours.

## From Open-Source Tools to Custom Solutions

These tools solve common challenges, but every nonprofit has unique needs. Upload your data, get immediate insights, and see what purpose-built analytics looks like. If these tools answer most of your questions—excellent, use them. If they spark ideas about what custom infrastructure could do for your specific workflows, CRM integrations, or board reporting needs, that's the conversation we specialize in.

The open-source tools demonstrate our approach: understand the domain deeply, build for actual workflows, make complex analytics accessible. Our custom client work takes this further—tailored dashboards, automated reporting pipelines, predictive models, and data infrastructure that actually fits how your team works.

## What Should Come Next?

This is where I need your help.

I've built these tools based on pain points I've seen repeatedly in my consulting work. But I'm one person with one perspective. **What analytics challenges keep you up at night? What tools would transform your work if they existed and were affordable?**

Some ideas I'm considering:
- **Volunteer Analytics Dashboard**: Track hours, retention, skill mapping, and impact
- **Program Impact Calculator**: Outcome tracking, cost-effectiveness analysis, beneficiary demographics
- **Event ROI Tool**: Ticket sales, sponsorships, expense tracking with multi-year trends
- **Email Campaign Analyzer**: Open rates, conversions, segmentation insights without Mailchimp's data science team
- **Major Donor Prospecting Assistant**: Wealth screening alternatives, engagement scoring
- **Budget Variance Tracker**: Real-time budget vs. actual with forecasting

But those are my ideas. **What would actually move the needle for your organization?**
