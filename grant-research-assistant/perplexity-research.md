# Essential Metrics and 990-PF Fields for Evaluating Foundation Health and Grantmaking Patterns

## Main Takeaway

To help small-to-mid-size nonprofits prioritize and evaluate foundation grant prospects using public IRS Form 990-PF data, the most meaningful and practical metrics go far beyond simple payout rates. By focusing on fields and ratios that illuminate foundation capacity, giving trends, financial health, administrative efficiency, and grantmaker alignment, nonprofits can efficiently vet and prioritize prospects for cold outreach—even without professional grant writing experience.

***

## 1. **Key Financial Health Indicators for Private Foundations**

### **A. Payout Rate and Qualifying Distributions**
- **Metric**: $$(\text{Grants Paid} \div \text{Total Assets}) \times 100$$
- **IRS 5% Rule**: Foundations must distribute at least 5% of average assets annually for charitable purposes; this is tracked as "qualifying distributions."
- **Benchmark**: Median national payout rates range from 5.2–6.2%, with 7–8% considered generous, and anything below 5% a strong red flag unless offset by multi-year payouts or rapid asset growth.[1][2][3][4]

### **B. Administrative Efficiency Ratios**
- **Metric 1**: $$\text{Administrative Expenses} \div \text{Total Assets}$$
- **Metric 2**: $$\text{Administrative Expenses} \div \text{Total Grants Paid}$$
- **Benchmark**: Median admin expense ratio as % of assets for small foundations is ~0.77%; industry norms for small foundations range from 0.5–2%. As % of grants paid, expect 13–18% for small foundations. An admin expense ratio above 20% often signals excessive overhead, while below 0.5% suggests lean operations or potential underreporting.[5][6]

### **C. Asset Growth and Endowment Sustainability**
- **Metric**: $$ \text{Net Asset Change} = \text{End-of-Year Net Assets} - \text{Prior-Year Net Assets} $$
- **Metric**: Average annual investment return; compare to benchmarks (typical foundation returns are 8–10% net investment return annually).[7]
- **Interpretation**: Declining assets year-over-year may signal shrinking grant budgets. Steady or growing assets along with steady payout rates suggest sustainable giving.

### **D. Program Expense Ratio**
- **Metric**: $$\text{Charitable Distributions} \div \text{Total Expenses}$$
- **Benchmark**: 65–75% spent on programs (including grants) is considered healthy; below 50% signals a red flag in efficiency.[8][9]

***

## 2. **Most Valuable 990-PF Fields for Grantseekers**

### **A. Grantmaking Focus and Alignment**
- **Part XV (Grants Paid)**: Lists grantee names, locations, amounts, and sometimes brief purpose descriptions. Reveals program areas and geographic scope directly.[10][11]
    - *Fields*: Grantee Name, Amount, City/State, Purpose
- **Multi-year analysis**: Reviewing several years uncovers enduring priorities, average grant size/frequency, and detection of mission alignment.

### **B. Financial Stability and Endowment Metrics**
- **Part I (Revenue & Expenses, line 25 & 5)**: Total grants paid (line 25), Fair market value of assets (line 5).[12][10]
- **Part III (Changes in Net Assets)**: End-of-year and prior year net assets; tracks sustainability.[12]
- **Part XI–XII**: Calculation of qualifying distributions—confirming compliance with the 5% minimum distribution requirement.[13][14][15]

### **C. Giving Patterns and Board/Decision-maker Data**
- **Part XV–Part VIII**: Gives grantmaking history and summary of direct charitable activities/program-related investments.
- **Part VIII (Officers, Directors, Trustees)**: Reveals board composition and potential for networking/relationship building.[16][10]
- **Supplementary Schedule B**: May reveal more detail on grant purposes and application competitiveness where disclosed.[10]

## 3. **Industry Benchmarks and Red Flags**

| Metric                      | Healthy Benchmark         | Red Flag                               | Practical Interpretation                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Payout Rate (Grants/Assets) | 5.5–8% national median   | <5% consistently                      | Generous grantmakers pay above 7%; <5% = very conservative[1][2][4][3][17]|
| Admin Expense Ratio         | 0.5–2% (assets); 13–18% (grants paid) | >20% (assets or grants)                | High overhead may mean limited grant dollars[5][6]      |
| Asset Trend                 | Flat or growing          | Declining across >3 years             | Shrinking assets → reduced future grantmaking[7]         |
| Program Expense Ratio       | 65–75%                   | <50%                                   | More spending on programs = more money for grantees[8][9]|
| Reserve Months (Liquidity)  | 3–6 months cash on hand  | <1 month                               | Foundation can weather volatility and sustain giving[18][19]|

***

## 4. **Composite Scores and Indices for Foundation Health**

- **Charity Navigator**: Focuses on public charities, not 990-PF filers, but uses Accountability & Finance, Program Expense, and Cost to Raise $100 as composite scores for eligible nonprofits.[9][20]
- **GuideStar (Candid)**: Levels (Bronze through Platinum Seal of Transparency) based on data disclosure, not calculated ratios.[9]
- **Financial Health Analysis Tool (FMA)**: Used by grantmakers to visualize trends: operating surpluses/deficits, months of cash on hand, net asset growth, and expense mix. These dashboards combine several 990 fields for a practical overview.[21][22]

***

## 5. **Metrics to Prioritize Foundation Prospects for Nonprofits**

### **A. Likelihood of Funding (Alignment and Past Grants)**
- **"Similar Past Grants"**: Check if the foundation funded organizations with similar missions, sizes, and geography in Part XV.[23][10][12]
    - *Tip*: High repeat grantee frequency may indicate "closed networks." Still, even if new grantees appear every year, that signals an openness to newcomers.
    - *Field*: Part XV Grantee Names, Purposes, Cities/States

### **B. Application Competitiveness Indicators**
- **Average Grant Size & Frequency**: Large number of small grants or regular cycles signal lower competitiveness than few large grants to same orgs.
- **Unsolicited Proposal Policy**: The presence of policies or application instructions in supplementary disclosures, or reference to only pre-selected grantees, signals openness.[24][25]
    - *Statistic*: Candid reports only ~23% of foundations state they accept unsolicited proposals, but disclosure rates don't fully match real-world practice. Red flag: Always the same grantees, no openness to new applicants.[25]

### **C. Responsiveness Signals**
- **Board and Staff Data**: Foundation’s board in Part VIII sometimes overlaps with grantee leadership or shows connections; warm introductions may improve odds for nonprofits.[16]
- **Direct Charitable Activities (Part IX-A)**: If the foundation describes outreach programs or local convenings, it may be more accessible for community-based organizations.
- **Narrative disclosures**: Some forms include mission statements or grant strategies—if these mention new initiatives, re-granting, or special programs, responsiveness is higher.

| Is there a chance for new grantees?| Part XV & disclosures (frequency of new grantees, policies)                            | Repeat vs. new grantee tracking             |
| Do they fund in our region?        | Part XV (City/state of grantee organization)                                           | Match to target region (New England)        |

## How Nonprofits Can Use These Metrics

- **Filter prospects first by geographic region and mission alignment using Part XV data.**
- **Estimate average grant sizes and payout ratios. Flag those with consistently above-benchmark rates (≥7%) as "generous" funders.**
- **Check administrative expense ratios to avoid high-overhead, low-impact foundations.**
- **Review multi-year trends for increases or decreases in assets and giving; prioritize foundations with stable or growing resources.**
- **Search for direct evidence of openness in application policies, or repeated new grantees; don't be discouraged by low unsolicited rates, as relationship-building often trumps public policy disclosure.**
- **Use board lists to identify connections for potential warm outreach.**

***

### For Technical Implementation

- **All above metrics can be calculated directly from fields included in the ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer API.**
- **Prioritize records and dashboards that show:**
    - Mission/program alignment (text/region match)
    - Asset and giving history
    - Payout and admin ratios
    - Average and variability of grant sizes
    - Frequency of new grantees
    - Board/director overlap analysis

These tangible, interpretable metrics enable even novice grant seekers to target opportunities with confidence, maximizing time invested and elevating the odds of securing support from aligned, healthy, and responsive foundations.
